With this tool you can scrape media as well as metadata for  \n","1. Instagram accounts\n","2. Hashtags\n","\n","**How to Use:**\n","For running or adapting this Colab Notebook you need to create a copy in you \n","\n","1.   Google drive: **File → Save a copy in Drive**. I will be stored in a folder ```Colab Notebooks```. Open this file with Google Colab and run the cells consecutively by pressing the **Play** button or pushing **shift+enter**.\n","2.   Instagram blocks most requests if no user credentials are provides. Since this information is sensitive it will be stored in a config file on Google Drive: \n","  - Download the Instagram config template from: http://tiny.cc/instagram-config-template\n","  -  Add your information using your preferred code editor like [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). \n","  - Upload to your Google Drive. I assume that you rename the template file to ```instagram_config.ini``` and place it in a folder named ```Colab_Data/Configs``` in ```MyDrive```.\n","\n","**BEWARE: Instagram might block your account, if you use this tool. It is recommended to create a dedicated research account that is completely separate from any Instagram accounts you value and do not want to get blocked or deleted by the platform. This requires using a separate email address and potentially a separate cell phone number for veryfying the account.**\n","\n","**Important notes:**\n","- Code is hidden in the background of Colab forms. For viewing and editing the code **double click** cell or select  **View → Show/hide code**\n","- Data will be stored in Google Drive in the folder ```Colab Data```. A connection to your drive will be authenticated when running setup code cells. This is temporary and only your current notebook will be conncted to your drive. The connection will be revoked when the notebook is terminated or by selecting **Runtime → Factory reset runtime**.\n","\n","\n","**Credits:** This notebook was written by Marcus Burkhardt. It provides a user interface for the command line application [instagram-scraper](https://github.com/arc298/instagram-scraper) which is maintained by GitHub user [arc298](https://github.com/arc298/). With this tool you can use Google Colab as runtime and Google Drive as cloud storage for retrieved data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"oLTj7lsf8MI4"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Setup 1: Mount Google Drive for Loading and Storing Data\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive', force_remount=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"L-brkUZx7xwc"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Setup 2: Install and Load Required Libraries and Run Setup Procedures\n","\n","# Import Libaries\n","import os\n","import json\n","import time\n","import configparser \n","import importlib\n","import shutil\n","import subprocess\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n","\n","#import pandas as pd\n","#from datetime import datetime\n","\n","# Install Libraries\n","if importlib.util.find_spec('instagram_scraper') is None:\n","  !pip3 install instagram-scraper\n","\n","# Defining path variable for config path\n","config_path = os.path.join(\"gdrive\", \"MyDrive\", \"Colab_Data\", \"Configs\")\n","if not os.path.isdir(config_path):\n","  os.makedirs(config_path)\n","\n","# Defining path variable for data path\n","data_path = os.path.join(\"gdrive\", \"MyDrive\", \"Colab_Data\", \"Data\", \"Instagram-Scraper\")\n","if not os.path.isdir(data_path):\n","  os.makedirs(data_path)\n","pfile = os.path.join(data_path, 'protocol_queries.json')\n","\n","try: \n","  # Reading config and setting configuration values\n","  config = configparser.ConfigParser()\n","  config.read(os.path.join(config_path, \"instagram_config.ini\"))\n","\n","  user_email = str(config['Instagram']['user'])\n","  user_pwd = str(config['Instagram']['pwd'])\n","\n","  # Check if API credentials were successfully parsed\n","  if isinstance(user_email,str) and isinstance(user_pwd,str):\n","    print('Successful parsed config data.')\n","\n","except:\n","  print('Error reading or parsing the config.')\n","\n","debug = False"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"IgH6JowL0iYB"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Setup 3: Definition of Core and Support Functions Used by the Tool(s)\n","\n","def check_path(path):\n","  if not os.path.isdir(path):\n","    os.makedirs(path)\n","\n","def load_protocol(fname):\n","  if os.path.isfile(fname):\n","    with open(fname, 'r') as infile:\n","      return json.load(infile)\n","  else:\n","    return []\n","\n","def save_protocol(protocol, fname):\n","  with open(fname, 'w') as outfile:\n","    json.dump(protocol, outfile, indent=4)\n","\n","def make_protocol(tmp_params):\n","  tmp = {}\n","  tmp['timestamp'] = time.time()\n","  last = None\n","  for item in tmp_params:\n","    if last and last == 'instagram-scraper':\n","      tmp['query'] = item\n","    elif last in ['-u', '-p', '-d']:\n","      pass\n","    elif last in ['--maximum', '--media-types', '--latest-stamps']:\n","      tmp[last[2:]] = item\n","    elif item.startswith('--'):\n","      tmp[item[2:]] = True\n","    last = item\n","  \n","  if 'commments' in tmp:\n","    tmp['media-metadata'] = True\n","  return tmp\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"Ucue6qzVgxO9"},"outputs":[],"source":["protocol = load_protocol(pfile)\n","\n","#@title # **Retrieve User Data** \n","#@markdown ##
