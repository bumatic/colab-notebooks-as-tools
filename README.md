# Colab Notebooks as Tools

This repository contains a number of Juppyter notebooks serving as digital methods tools that I created for use with Google Collaboratory. Running these notebooks assumes that you connect to your Google Drive account for loading config data – such as API keys – and storing results. 

Currently existing tools:

1. Telegram-Message-Retrieval.ipynb
2. Scrape Bitchute Platform Recommendations.ipynb
3. Query Google Play and Retrieve Similar Network.ipynb
4. Query Apple App Store and Retrieve Similar Network.ipynb
5. Github_Repository_Data.ipynb
