# Colab Notebooks as Tools

This repository contains a number of Juppyter notebooks with digital methods tools that I created for use with Google Collaboratory. Since a Google account is required for executing a notebook with Colab the notebooks are set up to make use of your private Google Drive for storing sensitive config data as well as your results. You will be prompted for authentification. For storing data a directory *Colab_Data* will be created automatically if it does not yet exist in your Google Drive. Due to this setup these notebooks will not work properly with *Binder*.

To run any these notebooks visit: [colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). In Google Colab go to File/Open Notebook, select Github and paste "bumatic/colab-notebooks-as-tools" as pointer to this repository. Now a list of available notebooks appears. Select the tool you want to run and open it.
