For running or adapting this Colab Notebook you need to create a copy in you Google drive: **File → Save a copy in Drive**. I will be stored in a folder ```Colab Notebooks```. Open this file with Google Colab and run the cells consecutively by pressing the **Play** button or pushing **shift+enter**.\n","2. Using the Github API requires authentication. You need to sign up for a free account and create a [personal API access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).\n","3. Since API access tokens are sensitive data they will be stored in a config file on Google Drive: \n","  - Download the Github config template (http://tiny.cc/github-config-template)\n","  -  Add your information using your preferred code editor like [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). \n","  - Upload to your Google Drive. I assume that you rename your file to ```github_config.ini``` and place it a folder named ```Colab Data/Configs```.\n","\n","**Important notes:**\n","- Code is hidden in the background of Colab forms. For viewing and editing the code **double click** cell or select  **View → Show/hide code**\n","- Data will be stored in Google Drive in the folder ```Colab Data```. A connection to your drive will be authenticated when running setup code cells. This is temporary and only your current notebook will be conncted to your drive. The connection will be revoked when the notebook is terminated or by selecting **Runtime → Factory reset runtimme**.\n","\n","\n","**Credits:** \n","\n","This notebook was written by Marcus Burkhardt. For interacting with the Github API this notebook uses the PyGithub library (https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/), which provides higher level functionalities for interacting with the Github API.
